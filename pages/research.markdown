My current project aims to develop an imaging tool to diagnose cornea infections using ultraviolet
fluorescence. Cornea infections typical impact about 2 million people per year, mostly in
developing and agricultural countries, and are notoriously hard to diagnose. Typically
an ophthalmologist will scrape the surface of an eye to collect microbes to identify them, but this
only works about half of the time. An incorrect diagnosis can lead to ineffective treatment and in
some cases the incorrect treatment can make the infection worse, leading to blindness.

Our goal is to develop a fluorescence imaging tool that can identify microbes based
on the color or wavelength of the fluorescence emission.
