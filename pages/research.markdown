I currently work on a variety of projects with the ultimate goal of low-cost diagnosis and monitoring of
eye diseases. Ongoing projects use fluorescence imaging to diagnose corneal disease, surface infections,
and oxidation in the lens. To achieve this, I use a combination of experimental and computational methods
to understand the optical properties of biomolecules from first principles, and then develop optical tools
to exploit those properties. 

# Corneal disease and lens oxidation

Corneal disease is a leading cause of preventable blindness in both developing and developed countries. However,
most current and state-of-the-art diagnostic tools only detect changes in the shape of the eye, which is not a
reliable measure of disease. These state-of-the-art techniques are also very expensive. Similarly, cataracts
are responsible for around 100 million cases of blindness or severely impaired vision worldwide. 
However, we have no reliable way to observe damage or oxidation of the lens.

I am developing ASUVF imaging as a rapid and low-cost method that can simultaneously detect and quantify corneal aberrations
and oxidation of the lens. Ongoing work focuses primarily on understanding:
1. Chemical composition of the aging and oxidized lens
1. Optical properties and molecular electronic structure of the lens constituents
1. Distribution of biomolecules in the lens and cornea tissue
1. Radiative transfer in the anterior segment of the eye
1. Engineering design and computer vision analysis

# Detecting and discriminating microbial infections

Corneal ulcers and other surface infections (*e.g.*, chronic wounds) also impact a large number people worldwide
and can be very difficult to diagnose. Optical methods have the potential to replace time-consuming laboratory
diagnostics with a rapid, low-cost point-of-care test. 

Similar to ASUVF imaging, I am developing fluorescence-based methods to detect and discriminate between different
species of microorganisms that are commonly associated with infections. Ongoing work focuses on understanding:
1. Chemical composition of common microorganism cells
1. Optical properties and molecular electronic structure of cell constituents
1. Elastic scattering and internal fields of typical cell geometries
1. Diagnostic design, optimization, and computer vision analysis
