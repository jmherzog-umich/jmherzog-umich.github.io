I developed and maintain several open-source scientific software packages that I
have used in my research to study radiative transfer using a variety of technique.
These software packages include:

### [MCRAD: Monte Carlo RAdiation Diffusion](/code/mcrad)
**MCRAD** is a *Monte Carlo* radiative transfer code written in C++ that can be 
used to investigate radiative transfer (absorption, scattering, diffusion, reflection,
and transmission of light) in simple geometries.



### [librad: C++ radiative transfer library](/code/librad)
**librad** is a C++ library that calculates solutions to functions ($$X$$, $$Y$$, $$H$$) 
that are used to solve the radiative transfer equation analytically. The functions
$$X$$, $$Y$$, and $$H$$ are the solutions to a set of integro-differential 
equations and can be difficult to calculate.
  
  
  
### [Ray tracer](/code/raytracer)
