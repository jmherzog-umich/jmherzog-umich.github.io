I develop and maintain several open-source scientific software packages that I
have used in my research to study radiative transfer using a variety of technique.
These software packages include:

### [MCRAD: Monte Carlo RAdiation Diffusion](/code/mcrad)
**MCRAD** is a *Monte Carlo* radiative transfer code written in C++ that can be 
used to investigate radiative transfer (absorption, scattering, diffusion, reflection,
and transmission of light) in simple geometries. I use this software package to investigate fluorescence in highly scattering media.



### [librad: C++ radiative transfer library](/code/librad)
**librad** is a C++ library that calculates solutions to functions
(Chandrasekhar's $$X$$, $$Y$$, and $$H$$ functions) that are used to solve the
radiative transfer equation analytically. The functions $$X$$, $$Y$$, and $$H$$
are the solutions to a set of integro-differential equations that are
notoriously difficult to evaluate.
